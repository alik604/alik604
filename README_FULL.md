# Educational Background and Professional Interests
* [My website](https://alik604.github.io/mySite)
* [Resume](https://github.com/alik604/alik604/blob/master/Resume.pdf)


I am a 4th year Cognitive science major at Simon Fraser University, with a background in data science (*which includes machine learning*) for cyber-security and finance. This skill set is bolstered with natural lanaguge processing & data mining-- as they are often necessities. I am also familiar reverse engineering APIs like that of WealthSimple, my stock broker. President of Cognitive Science Student Society (2021-2022), I started as the VP (2019-2020), and chair of the steering committee (2022).   

My favorite course was [CMPT 419/726: Machine Learning](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020sp-cmpt-726-x1/pages/), a [reasearch project](https://github.com/alik604/WallStreetBets_LSTM/blob/master/Paper%20-%20Predicting%20the%20S%26P%20500%20with%20LSTMs%20and%20GloVe.pdf) based *(Undergrad & Graduate split)* course. I took it at the end of my second year, I received an `A`  

> Also interested in general software development, in particular to following topics: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Backend-end web development (Server and APIs), Android, Low level programming, and working with EEG (brain waves) and itâ€™s associated signal processing  

Research Interests: Predictive modeling of Human behavior

# Personal Projects - Past:

Ordered chronologically

## [The "MNIST" of Brain Digits](https://github.com/alik604/mnist_brain)
 - Given the brain signal(s) of 2 seconds each, captured with the stimulus of seeing a digit (from 0 to 9) and thinking about it, determine what the digit is
- [Network Intrusion Detection](https://github.com/alik604/cyber-security)
  - [CO-OP project report](https://github.com/alik604/cyber-security/blob/master/anomalyDetection/co-op%20project.pdf)
- [CMPT 318: Cyber Security(R; Machine learning class)](https://github.com/alik604/classes/tree/master/CMPT318)
    - Anomaly Detection in household electrical consumption data. Used HMMs
- [chromePasswordThieve ](<https://github.com/alik604/chromePasswordThieve>)
  - Decrypt passwords saved in chrome and email them out
- [Back door written in python](https://github.com/alik604/myPyBackDoor)
  - Download, Create, and Delete Files. Execute custom CMD commands
- [bandwidth-hog](https://github.com/alik604/bandwidth-hog)
  - Download a file many times, but do not save the data. Useful for stressing out a network... possibly your own
- [keylogger, DLL injection, unExpectedProcessChecker, and Windows registry tools](https://github.com/alik604/cyber-security/tree/master/Several%20Utilities%20made%20by%20me)


## [openCV object detection](https://github.com/alik604/OpenCV-projects)
All my [OpenCV-projects](https://github.com/alik604/OpenCV-projects) were made over reading break 2019
1. Find an Ali. Used this [educational source](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/?completed=/mog-background-reduction-python-opencv-tutorial/)
   - Facial recognition using a [HAAR cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) (Very basic)
2. License Plate OCR
   + Given an image of a License plate, Output all the text found.
   + I failed to process the image in a way such that pyTesseract-OCR will work.

## SFU Robotics Club
* [I made the website: http://sfuskynet.ca/](http://sfuskynet.ca/)
  + [repo](https://github.com/alik604/sfuskynet)
* Code review for the movement system for Robots (7 in total; same code on all but one)

## Web Development
* [Stock watch list and simulator](https://github.com/alik604/stockApp)
* [Online chat](https://github.com/alik604/fullStack/tree/master/ChatIO-online-chat-app)
  + [Deployed here](http://whispering-island-50637.herokuapp.com/?)
* [SFU Robotics Club website: http://sfuskynet.ca/](http://sfuskynet.ca/)
  + [repo](https://github.com/alik604/sfuskynet)
* Torrent client in Node.js
   + This is something I've been wanting to do since the end of high school. I it found too intimidating. Now that there are better resources online, I took another shoot at it.  
   + I learned from examples [1](https://github.com/allenkim67/allen-torrent), [2](https://github.com/marti-1/bittc)

## Android
