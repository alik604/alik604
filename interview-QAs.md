### Tell me a little about yourself

I am a 4th year Cognitive science major at Simon Fraser University, with a background in data science (*which includes machine learning*) for cyber-security and finance. This skill set is bolstered with natural lanaguge processing & data mining-- as they are often necessities. I am also familiar reverse engineering APIs like that of WealthSimple, my stock broker. President of Cognitive Science Student Society (2021-2022), I started as the VP (2019-2020), and chair of the steering committee (2022).    

### What did you do at your ~~last~~ first internship 

- Heavily automated the Digital Forensics investigation process.
- Solely handled Incident Response on all Canadian endpoints for two weeks.
- Preformed basic reverse engineering to modify a program's execution.
- Conducted inventories of internet-facing assets.
- Audited endpoints and firewalls for compliance.
- Assisted in drafting the Technical Architecture and Security Document, for the purchase & deployment of a North America wide EDR solution.
- Deployed and Evaluated new software and conducted acceptance testing. Some of the softwares are ELK (an open-source SIEM), Identity and Access Management solutions, and ALSID, an active directory monitoring solution.
- I chose my CO-OP report to be on Anomaly detection for finding abnormalities in both network traffic and financial data. I used my learnings to expand my Time Series Forecasting skills.

### What are your weaknesses?

working with poor documentation for non-code products (nessus scanner config, Mircosoft AD, LDAP)

### **Describe your ideal role**

a place where my work is stimulating and challenging, I don’t like to lay around doing nothing. ideally flexible hours, so a can work 6h one day, and 10h the next... life doesnt like 8h days very much. 



**Can you explain why you’ve bounced around to many different types of roles (in unrelated areas)?**

prevents burnout. Trust me, i’m a cogs major :)

*  I’ve heard google does this for the same reason.
