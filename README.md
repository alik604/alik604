    <summary>⚡️About me (Click to Expand) </summary>
    
+ ⏳ I’m currently
    - 🌱 Learning: Neural Networks, the math behind - Attension, Transformers, Bayesian 
+ 💬 Let's discuss: Whether one should risk their 'professional image' to enforce best practices and ["The maxim of manner"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html), for instance in academia. 
    - 😡 Something I hate: When someone refers you to their paper, which provides minimal information and delegates to another paper.
    - 🤬 SomeThing I loath: `Splunk`. It is very hard to inport a package into Machine Learning ToolKit without doing something hacky. Often I must run a search twice   
+ ⚡ Famous People whom I look up to: Khabib Nurmagomedov, George hotz, Elon Musk, Ben Goertzel

I am a 4th year Cognitive Science major at Simon Fraser University, with a background in data science (*which includes machine learning*) for cyber-security and finance. This skill set is bolstered with natural lanaguge processing & data mining-- as they are often necessities. I am also familiar reverse engineering APIs like that of WealthSimple, my stock broker. President of Cognitive Science Student Society (2021-2022), I started as the VP (2019-2020), and chair of the steering committee (2022).   


> My favorite course was [CMPT 419/726: Machine Learning](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020sp-cmpt-726-x1/pages/), a [reasearch project](https://github.com/alik604/WallStreetBets_LSTM/blob/master/Paper%20-%20Predicting%20the%20S%26P%20500%20with%20LSTMs%20and%20GloVe.pdf) based course. I took it at the end of my second academic year, I received an `A`. 
>
> A year later I took [CMPT 419/720: Robotic Autonomy](https://github.com/alik604/ra), which was by the same professor but focused on robotics, via optimal control and reinforment learning. I received an `A+` and worked as a Research Assistant at the [MARS Lab](https://sfumars.com/people/khizr-ali-pardhan/) over the subsequent summer continuing [our  project](https://github.com/alik604/ra). Both these courses were Undergrad & Graduate split.
